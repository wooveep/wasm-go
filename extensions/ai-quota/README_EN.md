description: Configuration reference for read-only Redis balance admission.
---

> Plugin version: `1.0.4`

A transport failure during the read-only balance GET is retried once. Persistent failure returns 503. Redis server errors and invalid or nonpositive balances do not trigger transport retries; wallet mutations are never replayed.

## Overview

`ai-quota` reads Console- or billing-service-derived Redis hot balance during
request-header processing. A balance greater than `0` allows the request.
Zero and negative balances return the fixed `403 no_balance` response. A
missing key follows `missing_balance_policy`.

This request admission is the plugin's final account enforcement action for
the request. The plugin treats Redis balance hot data as read-only input and
does not mutate account state. Console or billing-service owns authoritative
accounts, settlement, statements, reconciliation, and Redis hot-data rebuilds.

Recognizable, opaque, streaming, cache, local, error, and missing-usage
responses do not trigger another quota decision, price lookup, Redis write, or
account mutation.

## Request scope

- Missing or explicit `path_scope: legacy_suffixes` preserves legacy suffix
  gating. The default suffixes are `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/messages`.
- `path_scope: bound_target` processes every request already selected by the
  Higress binding target. Omitted or literal-empty filters add no narrowing
  and require no synthesized path list.
- In `bound_target`, explicitly non-empty `enable_path_suffixes` and
  `enable_methods` are advanced intersection filters. When both are supplied,
  both must match; neither filter can expand the binding target.

## Configuration

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `redis` | object | none | Redis connection; `service_name` is required |
| `quota_scope` | string | `global` | Quota scope for the current route or rule |
| `provider` | string | `default` | Provider identifier for the admission context |
| `tenant_header` | string | `x-mse-tenant` | Tenant identity request header |
| `consumer_header` | string | `x-mse-consumer` | Consumer identity request header |
| `balance_key_template` | string | `billing:balance:{tenant}:{quota_scope}:{consumer}` | Balance key template |
| `path_scope` | string | `legacy_suffixes` | `legacy_suffixes` or `bound_target` |
| `enable_path_suffixes` | []string | legacy defaults | Optional path filter |
| `enable_methods` | []string | none | Optional exact-case HTTP method filter |
| `missing_balance_policy` | string | `deny` | Missing balance policy: `deny` or `allow` |

`redis` supports `service_name`, `service_port`, `username`, `password`,
`timeout`, and `database`. The default port is `6379` (`80` for static
services), the default timeout is `1000ms`, and the default database is `0`.

## Example

```yaml
redis:
  service_name: redis-service.default.svc.cluster.local
  service_port: 6379
  username: <redis-username>
  password: <redis-password>
  timeout: 1000
  database: 0
tenant_header: x-mse-tenant
consumer_header: x-mse-consumer
balance_key_template: "billing:balance:{tenant}:{quota_scope}:{consumer}"
path_scope: legacy_suffixes
enable_path_suffixes:
  - /v1/chat/completions
  - /v1/messages
missing_balance_policy: deny
```

Rules override only `quota_scope`, `provider`, `path_scope`, and explicit path
or method filters. They inherit Redis, identity headers, the balance key
template, and the missing-balance policy. A provider-native route with no
additional filtering can use:

```yaml
quota_scope: route:qwen
provider: dashscope
path_scope: bound_target
```

Explicit non-empty filters only narrow the binding target.
`enable_methods` uses exact-case matching; examples use canonical uppercase:

```yaml
path_scope: bound_target
enable_path_suffixes:
  - /v1/responses
enable_methods:
  - POST
```

`ai-quota`, `ai-billing`, and `ai-statistics` share no private runtime state
and can be deployed independently.


## Event delivery and transport recovery

Ordinary admission performs a read-only GET. Only a host-reported Redis transport failure permits one additional GET of the same key, without another RedisInit. Writes are never retried. Missing or nonpositive balances, server errors and persistent transport errors retain their existing rejection semantics.
