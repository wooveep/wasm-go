## Function Description

`ai-cache` is a thin Higress Wasm-Go gateway cache plugin. In the online request
path it only reads Console-materialized cache records, validates them, replays
OpenAI-compatible responses, captures response facts, and emits `CacheEvent`
messages to Redis Stream.

The gateway plugin does not generate embeddings, run vector search, write
PostgreSQL, calculate prices, settle billing, repair or delete durable state, or
own upstream model credentials. Console and backend workers own materialization,
semantic lookup, embeddings, vector indexing, pricing, settlement, repair,
deletion, and reconciliation.

**Tips**

When the request carries `x-higress-skip-ai-cache: on`, the current request does
not use cached content and is forwarded to the upstream service. The response
from that request is not emitted as a cache event.

## Runtime Properties

Plugin execution phase: `default`
Plugin execution priority: `800`

## Runtime Responsibilities

The plugin is responsible for:

- Applying request gating by JSON `content-type`, `route_policy.enabled_path_suffixes`, and no-store signals.
- Extracting identity and request facts from `tenant_header`, `consumer_header`, `session_header`, and request context.
- Building a materialized lookup key from tenant, consumer, route, model, scope, policy, and request digest.
- Reading Console-generated structured replay records from Redis.
- Optionally calling Console `/internal/cache/lookup` with a short timeout after Redis miss.
- Validating materialized record schema, expiration, scope, tenant, consumer, route, model, policy, and digest.
- Replaying only safe structured responses or stream chunks on hit.
- Capturing eligible upstream response facts and emitting `CacheEvent` after response completion.
- Failing open on Redis, Console, parsing, validation, response capture, and event delivery failures.

The plugin is not responsible for:

- Online embedding, rerank, or vector search.
- PostgreSQL persistence, materialized record generation, repair, or deletion.
- Provider pricing, discounts, balances, billing settlement, or reconciliation.
- Backend model cost attribution.
- Cache management APIs or management-plane authorization.

## Configuration

The public `ai-cache` configuration keeps only the thin cache path: materialized
Redis lookup, optional Console lookup, CacheEvent Redis Stream, route policy,
identity headers, cache scope, policy version, and fail-open policy. Legacy
`vector`, `embedding`, `cache`, GJSON extraction paths, and response templates
are no longer exposed as resource plugin configuration.

## Materialized Replay Records

Materialized records are Console-owned Redis values using
`schema_version: ai-cache.materialized.v1`. A record must include tenant,
optional consumer, route, model, cache scope, cache policy version, request
digest, soft and hard expirations, `usage`, `finish_reason`, and either
`response` for non-stream replay or `stream_replayable: true` plus
`stream_chunks` for stream replay.

The plugin rejects unsupported schema versions, expired records, scope, tenant,
consumer, route, model, policy, digest, and malformed payload mismatches, then
continues the upstream request.

## CacheEvent

After an upstream response finishes, the plugin writes:

```text
XADD cache:events * event <CacheEvent JSON>
```

The event contains identity, route, model, request digest, policy, status code,
stream flags, gate flags, timing, and plugin version. When policy allows it, the
event may include user content, assistant content, usage, finish reason, and
safe provider or runtime facts.

The event must not include Authorization headers, API keys, internal bearer
tokens, Redis credentials, upstream provider credentials, or sensitive raw
content. Redis Stream delivery failures keep the user response unchanged.

## Plugin Order and Isolation

When `ai-memory` affects the answer, run `ai-memory` before `ai-cache`.
Recommended cache policy options are consumer-scoped cache, `policy_digest`
keys that include memory policy version and assembled memory digest, or
`bypass` until Console materializes memory-aware replay records.

`ai-cache` and `ai-memory` backend state must remain isolated: separate
PostgreSQL tables, Redis streams, Redis key prefixes, vector namespaces, payload
schemas, retention/deletion policies, management APIs, and authorization
boundaries.

## Billing Facts

On cache replay, `ai-cache` sets trusted gateway facts such as
`upstream_invoked=false` for `ai-billing`. Real upstream provider calls emit
`upstream_invoked=true`. These facts are not added to the user-visible OpenAI
response body, and user-supplied request or response body fields cannot control
them.
